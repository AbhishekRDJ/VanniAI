# AI/ML-Based Text-to-Text Machine Translation from Nepali and Sinhalese to English  
**Theme:** Heritage & Culture 🇮🇳  

---

## Introduction  

**Problem Statement:**  
A wealth of Nepali and Sinhalese literature exists in printed text form — rich in history, poetry, and cultural value — but it remains locked within regional language boundaries. The manual translation of such texts into English is slow, expensive, and inconsistent. This restricts access for global researchers, students, and cultural enthusiasts who wish to explore South Asian heritage.  

**Solution:**  
We propose an AI/ML-powered software that can automatically **extract Nepali and Sinhalese text from scanned documents, PDFs, or images**, and **translate it into English with high linguistic accuracy and cultural sensitivity**.  
Our system uses **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for text extraction, **Transformer-based models** for translation, and supports **offline processing** for secure use on internal networks. This will accelerate translation efforts, preserve heritage texts, and make regional literature globally accessible.

## Understanding the Challenge  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Nepali_Literature.jpg" width="200"/>
</p>

- Nepalese and Sinhalese heritage texts are often available **only in printed or scanned form**, making manual translation slow and error-prone.  
- Scholars, linguists, and cultural organizations lack an **automated multilingual translation tool** tailored to these underrepresented languages.  
- Existing translation tools like Google Translate offer **limited accuracy** for low-resource languages due to insufficient training data.  

Our solution bridges this gap with an AI-driven translation model that **learns contextual, cultural, and grammatical nuances**, ensuring heritage texts are preserved and accessible globally.
